# JavaScript/TypeScript Guidelines - Liquid Glass Snowcap Portfolio

## Core Principles
- Minimal JavaScript (<10 KB min+gz)
- No frameworks or runtime dependencies
- Vanilla JS with optional TypeScript
- Performance-first approach

## Animation Implementation
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for all animations
- Throttle scroll events and animations
- Implement reduced motion support
- Use `transform` and `opacity` only for 60fps

## Snow Particles System
```typescript
interface SnowParticle {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  size: number;
  speed: number;
  opacity: number;
}
```

## Parallax Implementation
- Use `IntersectionObserver` for scroll triggers
- Implement "breathing" parallax for mountain layers
- Support reduced motion preferences
- Throttle to 60fps

## Intersection Observer Usage
- Smooth reveal animations for sections
- Trigger glass panel slides
- Optimize performance with proper thresholds
- Support reduced motion

## Performance Optimization
- Debounce scroll events
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for animations
- Minimize DOM queries and updates
- Implement proper cleanup for event listeners

## Accessibility Features
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Screen reader compatibility
- Reduced motion detection and handling

## Build Process (Optional)
- Use esbuild for TypeScript compilation
- Minimize bundle size
- No external dependencies
- Static output for hosting

## Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Fallbacks for unsupported features
- Console logging for debugging
- No blocking errors
