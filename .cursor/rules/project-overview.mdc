# Liquid Glass Snowcap Portfolio - Project Overview

## Project Title
Liquid Glass Snowcap Portfolio

## One-liner
A fast, accessible, minimal personal site featuring a translucent, white snowcapped mountain hero with continuous, subtle motion and smooth scroll animations.

## Core Objectives
- Showcase projects and contact info with minimal UI and high readability
- Convey calm, cool, modern aesthetic using glassmorphism and icy whites
- Maintain 60fps animations and strong accessibility (WCAG AA)

## Visual Theme
- White background with cool accents
- Translucent "liquid glass" layers
- Snowcapped mountain built from layered semi-transparent SVG panels
- Glassmorphism effects throughout

## Motion Requirements
- Always subtly moving (sky shimmer, gentle snow particles, slow "breathing" parallax)
- Smooth scroll-triggered reveals for sections
- 60fps performance target
- Reduced motion support (disables loops/parallax)

## Minimal UI Design
- Sticky header with only two text links (Projects, Contact)
- Primary CTAs are inline text links, not buttons
- Frosted glass tiles for projects
- Thin glass panels for ridge reveal section

## Content Structure
1. **Hero**: Centered headline, one-line subtext, inline "View Projects" link; mountain behind text
2. **Projects**: 3–6 frosted glass tiles with title, abstract, SVG thumbnail, cool-blue tags
3. **Ridge reveal**: Thin glass panels slide in from left/right on scroll
4. **Footer**: Single sentence with inline email link

## Technical Constraints
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and TypeScript (optional small build with esbuild)
- No runtime dependencies or frameworks
- Inline SVG only; no raster images
- Minimal JS (<10 KB min+gz)
- Transform/opacity-only animations; throttle to rAF
- Static hosting (GitHub Pages or Netlify)
- Browser support: latest Chrome, Safari, Firefox

## Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG AA compliance
- Maintain AA contrast; text legible over moving backgrounds
- Visible focus states (2–3px accent outline)
- Fully keyboard navigable
- Reduced-motion support

## Performance Targets
- Lighthouse desktop: Performance ≥ 90, Accessibility ≥ 95, Best Practices ≥ 95
- No heavy images; CSS gradients for sky
- Minimal JS bundle size

## Copy Placeholders
- Hero H1: "Scaling ideas into reliable systems"
- Subtext: "I build AI/ML-powered web systems with clean UX and measurable outcomes."
- Ridge tagline: "Reliable. Measurable. Elegant."
- Footer: "Let's build something reliable—email me at goyalsarvagya@gmail.com"

## Deliverables
- [index.html](mdc:index.html) with semantic sections and inline SVG mountain
- [styles.css](mdc:styles.css) with variables, glass utilities, keyframes, responsive layout
- [app.ts](mdc:app.ts) for snow particles, parallax, intersection observers
- Optional [package.json](mdc:package.json) with scripts if bundling TypeScript

## Development Principles
- Favor clarity, small composable CSS, and minimal code
- No extra components or pages beyond spec
- Keep UI quiet and elegant; prioritize legibility and motion discipline
- Maintain glassmorphism aesthetic throughout
